# Company Management API

This API is designed to manage and query a list of companies with features like database seeding, fetching company details, filtering by industry, and sorting by revenue. It uses Node.js, Express, Sequelize, and SQLite.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** and **npm** installed.
- **SQLite** installed (or ensure the `sqlite3` npm package is used if SQLite is not separately installed).

### Installation

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install the dependencies by running:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Ensure `SQLite` database file (`database.sqlite`) is set up in the root folder, or update the configuration as needed in `lib/index.js`.

### Configuration

- The database is configured to use SQLite in `lib/index.js` with Sequelize.

### Starting the Server

Run the following command to start the server:

```bash
node app.js
```

The server will start on `http://localhost:3000`.
